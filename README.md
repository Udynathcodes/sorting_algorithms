#### 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

* This is one our Team project at alx. This one is about Data Structure and Algorithms

* This repository contains the Solutions of the project tast from I and my Team.


#### Learning Objectives

* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

	* At least four different sorting algorithms
	
	* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

	* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input

	* What is a stable sorting algorithm



#### Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

* All your files should end with a new line

* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

* You are not allowed to use global variables

* No more than 5 functions per file

* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.

* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h

* Don’t forget to push your header file

* All your header files should be include guarded
